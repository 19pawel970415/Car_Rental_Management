# Car Rental Company: Simplified Task

## Context
The goal is to design and implement a reservation management system for a car rental company using design patterns, SOLID principles, and good coding practices. The focus is on creating the necessary classes, interfaces, enums, and repositories. Functional implementations like GUI are not required.

## Requirements

### Functionalities (For Implementation in Main)
1. **Generate Cars:** Populate the database with car instances.
2. **Generate Markets:** Populate the database with market instances.
3. **Generate Reservations:** Populate the database with reservation instances.
4. **Generate Users:** Populate the database with user instances.

### Technical Requirements

#### Design Patterns
1. **Singleton:** Implement the Singleton pattern to manage repository instances (`CarsRepo`, `MarketsRepo`, `ReservationsRepo`, `UsersRepo`).
2. **Builder:** Use the Builder pattern for creating complex `User` and `Reservation` objects.
3. **Factory Method:** Apply the Factory Method pattern for creating different types of Markets.
4. **Abstract Factory:** Use the Abstract Factory pattern to manage car factories and their products for different brands.
5. **Adapter:** Implement the Adapter pattern to integrate with a new external library for the payment system:
   - **PaymentService Interface:** Create a `PaymentService` interface with a method `processPayment(Order order)`.
   - **ExternalPaymentSystem:** Create a class `ExternalPaymentSystem` with its own payment methods, differing from your `PaymentService` interface.
   - **ExternalPaymentAdapter:** Create an `ExternalPaymentAdapter` class to adapt the `ExternalPaymentSystem` to the `PaymentService` interface.
6. **Decorator:** Implement the Decorator pattern to enrich information about rented cars:
   - **CarInfoProvider Interface:** Extend the `Car` class by implementing the `CarInfoProvider` interface.
   - **CarInsuranceDecorator:** Create a decorator that adds information about the car's insurance.
   - **GPSDecorator:** Create a decorator that adds information about whether the car has a GPS system.
7. **Facade:** Implement the Facade pattern to simplify the reservation management process:
   - **ReservationProcessFacade:** Create a class `ReservationProcessFacade` that coordinates the reservation process by interacting with the following components:
      - **CarAvailabilityService:** For checking car availability.
      - **ExternalPaymentAdapter:** For handling payments.
      - **ReservationConfirmation:** For confirming reservations.
   - **Interface:** The `ReservationProcessFacade` class should have a method `reserve(Car car, Payment payment)`.
8. **Proxy:** Implement the Proxy pattern for user authorization:
   - **ReservationServiceProxy:** Implement the `ReservationServiceProxy` class, which acts as a proxy for `ReservationService`.
      - **Interface:** `ReservationServiceProxy` should implement the `ReservationService` interface.
      - **Logic:** Add logic to check user authorization before executing the `isAuthorized` method. Users from Germany have restricted access to foreign markets.
9. **Iterator:** Implement the Iterator pattern for employee iteration:
   - **EmployeeIterator:** Implement the `EmployeeIterator` class, which provides iteration functionality for the `EmployeesRepo` class.
      - **Interface:** `EmployeeIterator` implements the `Iterator<Employee>` interface.
      - **Logic:** Ensure iteration through the employees array in the `EmployeesRepo` class. The iterator supports standard iteration methods: `hasNext()` to check if there are more elements, and `next()` to retrieve the next employee. The implementation provides a way to traverse through the collection without exposing the underlying data structure.
10. **Observer:** Implement the Observer pattern for employee notifications:
   - **Abstract Employee Class:** Define an abstract `Employee` class with methods for handling messages and notifying observers.
   - **Concrete Observers:** Implement concrete classes `Manager` and `RentalRepresentative` that extend the abstract `Employee` class. These classes define specific behaviors for handling messages.
   - **GroupChat Subject:** Implement the `GroupChat` class as a subject that manages a list of employees (observers) and notifies them of new messages. It should include methods for adding and removing employees and sending messages.
   - **Interaction:** Demonstrate how messages are sent and received by implementing the `Main` class. This class should illustrate how messages are distributed to employees based on their types and how each employee handles them.
11. **State:** Implement the State pattern to manage the lifecycle of a reservation:
   - **ReservationState Interface:** Define the `ReservationState` interface with methods for transitioning between states (`previousState()`, `nextState()`) and getting state information (`getStateInfo()`).
   - **Concrete State Classes:** Implement the following concrete state classes representing the different states a reservation can be in:
      - `NewReservation`: Represents a new reservation. This state has no previous state and transitions to the `ToBePaidReservation` state.
      - `ToBePaidReservation`: Represents a reservation waiting to be paid. It can transition back to `NewReservation` or forward to `PaidReservation`.
      - `PaidReservation`: Represents a paid reservation. This is the final state and has no further transitions.
   - **Transition Logic:** Each state class should handle its specific transitions using the `nextState()` and `previousState()` methods.
   - **ReservationService Interface:** Create the `ReservationService` interface with methods `isAuthorized(User user)` and `transit(Reservation reservation)` to handle state transitions.
   - **ReservationServiceImpl Class:** Implement the `ReservationServiceImpl` class to handle the transition logic by invoking the state's `nextState()` method.
   - **ReservationServiceProxy:** Implement a proxy (`ReservationServiceProxy`) that checks user permissions before allowing a reservation to transition states. For example, restrict users from Germany from reserving cars in foreign markets.
   - **Interaction:** Demonstrate the state transitions and proxy behavior in the `Main` class, showing how reservations move from `NewReservation` to `PaidReservation` and how unauthorized users are prevented from making reservations.
12. **Strategy:** Implement the Strategy pattern for payment processing:
   - **PaymentMethod Interface:** Define an interface for payment methods that includes a method `processPayment(Reservation reservation, double amount)`.
   - **Concrete Payment Methods:** Implement concrete classes for different payment methods (`CreditCardPayment`, `CashPayment`, `BlikPayment`, `BitcoinPayment`), each processing payments through the `ReservationServiceProxy` to ensure state transitions are handled properly.
   - **Authorization Logic:** Use `ReservationServiceProxy` to check user authorization and manage state transitions during payment processing.

#### Good Practices
1. **Clean Code:** Ensure code readability by applying the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and using meaningful names.
2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoid code duplication by employing helper methods and classes.
3. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Keep the code simple and understandable; avoid unnecessary complexity.
4. **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It):** Implement only the classes, interfaces, and methods that are necessary for the current requirements.
5. **SOLID:** Apply SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) throughout the system.

## Task
